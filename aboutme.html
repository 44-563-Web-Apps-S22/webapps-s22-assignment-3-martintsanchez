            <h3>Meet Joe Black</h3>
            <p>I like this movie because it is a mix of drama and romance. The quality
                of the actors is amazing.

            <h3>Algorithm</h3>

            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree"> In the mathematical field of graph theory, a spanning tree T 
                of an undirected graph G is a subgraph that is a tree which includes all of the vertices of G. In general, a graph may 
                have several spanning trees, but a graph that is not connected will not contain a spanning tree. If all of the edges of G 
                are also edges of a spanning tree T of G, then G is a tree and is identical to T. </blockquote >
